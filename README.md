# jai
This is an open source alternate jai compiler.

Jonathan Blow is the original creator of the jai language. Design credit goes to him. Here is a link to his YouTube playlist where he suggests and demos his compiler:

This repository is by no means intended as competition for Jonathan Blow's compiler, but is rather a fun project.
At the time of writing, Blow has yet to release the first version of his compiler. That is why I started writing my own.

This compiler will not be compliant with Blow's language specification exactly, and it may have different features from Blow's jai language.
Blow's jai language and videos are simply the inspiration for this project.

Recommended to use Sublime Text 3 with this project. After cloning, open in Sublime and run the default build.
Recommended to have installed the Sublime Package Manager, SublimeGDB and Jai - someone has already written syntax highlighting for Jai for Sublime, might as well use it :)
